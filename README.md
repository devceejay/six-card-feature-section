This project is a responsive Six card feature section built using HTML and CSS to showcase different health-related services in a clean, modern layout.

## Live Demo:

## Highlights:

- With a focus on accessibility, I aimed for a soft, warm off-white shade with a hint of yellow for the background, offering good contrast with text.
- Used semantic HTML5 markup to best structure the content of the card
- CSS3 custom properties for styling
- Utilized Grid for a flexible card arrangement, making the design scalable and easy to adjust
- Adopted mobile-first workflow starting from smaller screens
- Implemented responsive design using media queries, making the cards stack beautifully on mobile and adjust automatically for tablet and desktop views
- Each card features a unique color scheme to visually distinguish the different health services while maintaining readability
- Applied hover effects on the cards to create an engaging experience
